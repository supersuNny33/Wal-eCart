# Wal-eCart
Project made for Sparkathon 
My Team developed a comprehensive web application for a Sparkathon project, using Flask and MongoDB. The application integrates product search, shopping list management, and Walmart store visualization. Additionally, I implemented item-item collaborative filtering for personalized product recommendations and integrated a churn prediction model using Logistic Regression. This project showcases my full-stack development skills, database management, and machine learning integration.
